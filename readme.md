# Lab | SQL Intro

In this lab, you will be using the [Sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) database of movie rentals. You can follow the steps listed here to get the data locally: [Sakila sample database - installation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html). You can work with two sql query files - `sakila-schema.sql` (creates the schema) + `sakila-data.sql` which inserts the data.

The ERD is pictured below - not all tables are shown, but many of the key fields you will be using are visible:

### Instructions

1. Use sakila database.
2. Get all the data from tables `actor`, `film` and `customer`.
3. Get film titles.
4. Get unique list of film languages under the alias `language`. Note that we are not asking you to obtain the language per each film, but this is a good time to think about how you might get that information in the future.
5.
  - 5.1 Find out how many stores does the company have?
